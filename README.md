# the use of artificial intelligence to analize the startup market: the probability of the success according to the features that a company has

Startups have a fundamental role in research and technological progress for all humanity. These are companies that, by introducing innovative products to the market, tend to make man's life better.
In fact, their products are usually aimed at creating something innovative, not present on the market, that no one had thought of before.
Usually the success of a company of this kind is a combination of several factors. The external factors that have an impact are essentially: the state in which the company is born, which is crucial for the laws existing in the territory; the competitors, that is, those who propose similar solutions on the market and the number of investors, which depend on the product that you want to create. In addition to external factors, what has the greatest impact on their success are the company's choices and what the startup will create.
This new way of doing business has been introduced recently. Consequently, there are many questions regarding the factors that have the greatest impact on the success of a startup on the market. In this sense, my thesis aims to shed light on these elements and through the use of artificial intelligence models, evaluate, based on the data returned by the study and research, what is really considered important for the growth and consolidation of a startup on the market.
